    <p>The actions of Amazon are questionable in regards to exhibiting ethical leadership. In regards to duty-based ethics, the work practices of Amazon do not align with the idea of choosing actions that are right. Underpaying workers and dehumanizing blue-collar workers does not align with  any of the ethical frameworks. Therefore, if Amazon wants to foster a better work environment for its employees, it is important for the company to adopt a policy that adheres to at least one of these ethical frameworks. The company owes its factory workers the ability to maintain their dignity and humanity while working. </p>

    <p>According to Business Insider, around 10% of Amazon employees in Ohio are in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), making Amazon one of the largest employers with employees on food stamps. Amazon has also built many of its centers using tax breaks from the government and public funds. However, despite the company's ability to build more centers and create more jobs using government assistance, many of the jobs, especially part-time jobs, pay so low that workers need to join the SNAP program. Through the consequentialist framework, Amazon should use its ability to create more jobs to actually benefit the workers and the economy. In order to achieve this, Amazon should be responsible for paying their workers well and improving working conditions for blue-collar workers.</p>

    <p>	One aspect of society that allows companies like Amazon to get away with underpaying many of their workers is society's tendency to value the success of large corporations over the wellbeing of its citizens. For instance, in the public discourse the health of an economy is often expressed in stock market gains while ignoring wealth inequality. This allows the government at all levels to give huge tax breaks to companies that propagate this inequality, and still remain popular. This can and should change with workers demanding that growth in the economy and productivity benefit everyone, not just those at the top.</p>

    <p>One could argue that technology has a negative role, in this instance. Despite the overarching benefits that technology provides society, real-time tracking of employees, such as in Amazon's newly patented wristband is not beneficial. This serves to only harm the employee, in no way will it help them because it will allow employers to nitpick the employees habits, no matter how small.

Sexual consent is an agreement between participants to sexual activity and to everything that happens during that sexual encounter. However, there may be situations where one of the participants is uncomfortable with saying “no” due to pressure, manipulation, or fear. Consent is also not constant and can always be withdrawn (Madigan). In such cases when consent is not certain, sexual partners should talk and listen to one another to make sure they are comfortable with everything happening (RAINN). It is also very important to acknowledge each other’s signals and body language in addition to verbal communication in order to identify enthusiastic consent. 
In regards to a sexual assault survivor who hasn’t come forward, many experts state that if the perpetrator is trusted by the victim, the victim may take years to realize what happened to them (Dewan). Based on virtue ethics, the victim believes the good the assaulter demonstrated throughout their lifetime outweighs the assaulter's wrongdoing. Someone who keeps making sexual advances after being given multiple “no’s” likely sees the other person’s eventual capitulation as proper consent. They do not realize that asking multiple times after being told “no” is a form of pressure and coercion in itself, especially if there is any power imbalance between them. Many men see a woman’s reluctance as a “fun challenge to overcome.”(Friedman) This idea is reinforced in the media and popular culture where we are shown many examples of protagonists aggressively pursuing women without regard for their desires.(Beck) However these men are usually portrayed as charming, and their actions are usually rewarded. While it is important to hold those who ignore the importance of enthusiastic consent accountable, it is also arguably even more important to change the perception and portrayal of consent in popular culture.
Technology has both helped and hurt the #MeToo movement. Apps like Good2Go aim to digitize the consent process but are “unlikely to aid a real victim” (Hess). We react with full support for the victims. From a utilitarian approach, believing the victims creates the greatest amount of good for those affected, which we believe is important. Consequentialist ethics states that something be judged based on its consequences. The consequence of believing the first victims that come out is that it will encourage more victims to come out and share their stories, which raises awareness and helps victims by removing the stigma of coming out.

        Computer science has, for the most part, always been a male-dominated field. Of course this is
        changing now, but decades ago (when the current GitHub and Uber employees were going through
        school) there were very few females in the mix, thus becoming a sort of "boys club". As one
        would expect, this culture permeated through university, and into the companies that these
        students went on to join. The sheer length of time that CS was male-dominated has made it
        hard for females to feel welcomed. This leads to issues such as men not trusting code that
        was written by a woman.

        The common thread in both the Uber and Github stories is that the systems put in place to 
        prevent harassment and discrimination failed completely. The HR department at Github took 
        the side of the high ranking executives over Hovrath despite clear evidence of harassment 
        while Uber's HR department straight up admitted to dismissing Fowler's complaints because 
        the offending persons were "high performers." The HR departments acted this way because 
        they exist to serve the company and by extension it's profit, so they will always act in a
        way that most serves the company's interests even if that comes at the expense of its 
        lower to middle level employees.

        In order for the culture of marginalizing women within the tech industry to be dismantled,
        those who perpetrate these biases must recognize their actions. Through the lens of virtue
        based ethics, those working in the tech industry will not discriminate against marginalized
        demographics but instead focus on the positive aspects of the person's work abilities and
        characteristics. Women must also continue to support other women, advocate for one another,
        and help one another surpass any obstacles that may come their way. Through duty-based ethics,
        people should also speak up when they witness gender discrimination occurring or are involved
        in any such scenario. This will inspire others to also speak up and bring about a change in
        the often unwelcoming atmosphere for women in the tech industry.

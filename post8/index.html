    <p>People who do not want to pay for things are obviously the people who
        benefit the most from software piracy. They are able to acquire any
        software they want, regardless of price. This is beneficial only to
        the ‘consumer’ in this case, because no money is being paid into the
        system that helped produce this content that the ‘consumer’ is enjoying.
    </p>

    <p>People justify piracy usually in one of two main ways. The first being
        that they do not see it as “stealing” in any sense because  the owner
        does not lose their copy and they were never going to spend money on it
        in the first place. The second is comes from a more altruistic point of
        view. This group sees piracy as a means of liberation for underprivileged
        people who could not otherwise purchase the software. An example they
        might use to show that piracy can be justified is a person who is searching
        for a job and cannot afford Microsoft Word.</p>

    <p>As discussed in the provided source, companies and independent developers
        can go bankrupt due to piracy. If none of the software users are willing
        to pay for the software, developers are unable to be compensated for their
        work. Pirated software also does not provide insight to the developers on
        the the popularity of the software. If the software is popularly pirated
        and rarely purchased, it may be hard to track actual total downloads of
        the software.

        Technology has led to both the increase and decrease of software piracy, as
        there are some technologies which aim to prevent piracy and some which end up
        contributing to its rise. For instance, free-to-play games which allow users
        to access most of the game content without paying can motivate more people to
        stop pirating games. Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems, as explained in
        Patwegar’s article, also protect copyrighted content by only allowing users to
        access the content using encryption keys. However, opponents of DRM believe that
        it restricts users to specific devices, restricts creators to specific platforms,
        and can easily be bypassed. From a duty-based perspective, anti-piracy tech does have
        good intentions to prevent piracy, but in the cases of technologies like DRM,
        these technologies often do not completely prevent piracy as intended. Streaming
        services initially were thought to have decreased piracy by making content available
        legally. But now that there are many streaming services with exclusive content, there
        are too many services for consumers to subscribe to if they want access to all this
        content, so consumers have become more motivated to simply pirate the content.
        Advertisements on piracy sites also generate significant revenue for these piracy
        sites which contributes to increasing software piracy.

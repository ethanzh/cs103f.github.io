    <p>     Sexual consent is an agreement between participants to sexual activity and to
        everything that happens during that sexual encounter. However, there may be
        situations where one of the participants is uncomfortable with saying "no" due to
        pressure, manipulation, or fear. Consent is also not constant and can always be
        withdrawn (Madigan). Duty-based ethics define ethical conduct as choosing
        actions that are right. In such cases when consent is not certain, the best way to do
        what is right is communication. Sexual partners should talk and listen to one
        another to make sure they are comfortable with everything happening (RAINN). It
        is also very important to acknowledge each other's signals and body language in
        addition to verbal communication in order to identify enthusiastic consent.

    <p> In regards to a sexual assault survivor who hasn't come forward, many experts state
        that if the perpetrator is trusted by the victim, the victim may take years to realize what
        happened to them (Dewan). Based on virtue ethics, the victim believes the good the
        assaulter demonstrated throughout their lifetime outweighs the assaulter's wrongdoing.
        Someone who keeps making sexual advances after being given multiple "no's" likely
        sees the other person's eventual capitulation as proper consent. They do not realize
        that asking multiple times after being told "no" is a form of pressure and coercion in
        itself, especially if there is any power imbalance between them. Many men see a
        woman's reluctance as a "fun challenge to overcome."(Friedman) This idea is
        reinforced in the media and popular culture where we are shown many examples of
        protagonists aggressively pursuing women without regard for their desires.(Beck)
        However these men are usually portrayed as charming, and their actions are usually
        rewarded. While it is important to hold those who ignore the importance of enthusiastic
        consent accountable, it is also arguably even more important to change the perception
        and portrayal of consent in popular culture.

    <p> Technology has both helped and hurt the #MeToo movement. Apps like Good2Go aim
        to digitize the consent process but are "unlikely to aid a real victim" (Hess). We react
        with full support for the victims. From a utilitarian approach, believing the victims
        creates the greatest amount of good for those affected, which we believe is important.
        Consequentialist ethics states that something be judged based on its consequences.
        The consequence of believing the first victims that come out is that it will encourage
        more victims to come out and share their stories, which raises awareness and helps
        victims by removing the stigma of coming out.

    <p>The Challenger was launched in untested conditions. It is almost certain that had the O-rings been
        tested under a wider variety of circumstances, the higher-ups at NASA would have OK'ed the decision
        to not follow through with the launch on January 26th. While these days we are able to simulate such
        launches with a high degree of accuracy, this was not the case in 1986. One could make the argument
        that had the group had more advanced technology, this loss of life would not have occurred.
        This might be an unfair assumption to make, given the amount of technical knowledge the group
        had at the time.

        The Whistleblowing Support Fund article and the Washington Post article discuss the perspectives of
        Roger Boisjoly and Bob Ebeling, two engineers who warned managers that the O-rings used in the Challenger
        rockets could freeze under extreme temperatures and risk the loss of human life. These engineers tried
        continuously to convince their managers to not proceed with the launch, but the managers dismissed
        these warnings and proceeded anyways. At this point, Boisjoly and Ebeling felt that there was nothing
        else they could do beyond this to surpass the authorities' decision. This is where the human tendency
        to obey authority comes into place. The final decision is often the one taken by the authority. Even
        when people like Boisjoly and Ebeling try to convince their authorities to change this final decision,
        the authorities often don't listen and their initial decision still holds, despite the negative repercussions
        it will cause.

    <p>When deciding whether or not the launch of the Challenger should be postponed, Bob Ebeling adopted a
        consequentialist ethical framework. Having lost his own son, Ebeling empathized with those who lost family
        members. Ebeling was aware of the emotional turmoil caused by death and that launching the Challenger could
        result in the death of others. Those who allowed the launch to go through were likely affected by their desire
        to protect their own standing within the company. They probably had a confirmation bias in determining the true
        risk of launching with the faulty o-rings. Had they not been under the pressure to go through with the
        launch and protect their careers, they likely would have had a less biased evaluation of the risk of launching
        with the o-rings.

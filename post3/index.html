    <p>     In this situation, instead of asking Alice to explain her code, Bob just rewrites
        Alice's code. He may have assumed the code wouldn't work since he couldn't understand it.
        Carlos must now defend Alice since he thinks her code is perfectly fine. He may now
        trust Alice more. However, since Bob rewrote the code without discussing with the group,
        Carlos may not trust Bob very much anymore with his responsibilities. Alice may feel that
        Bob went behind her back by rewriting her code before discussing with the group. This may cause
        Alice to feel more comfortable working with Carlos.
    </p>

    <p>
        This incident will most likely have a negative effect on the productivity and
        relationships of the group. For Alice, this may spark a sense of mistrust
        between herself and Bob. Alice and Carlos may feel uncomfortable presenting their
        ideas to Bob. This could then perpetuate a sense of dominance that Bob seems to
        have over his other group members. Additionally, productivity will decrease as
        the other group members will feel hesitant to contribute ideas and code to the
        project. Ultimately, this incident could negatively impact the relationship and
        group dynamic for Bob, Alice and Carlos.
    </p>

    <p> Carlos should help Bob should understand that although he may have had good
        intentions in rewriting Alice's code, in doing so he is essentially saying
        that he doesn't believe it is worth it to even try to help Alice make her code
        more understandable. This can understandably be interpreted by Alice as an
        insult to her abilities. Bob should apologize to her for this and explain
        that he just wanted what's best for the project. If no agreement can be made
        on which person's code is easier to understand, then Alice's code should be
        turned it as it was her assigned portion and both her and Carlos agree that her
        code is easy enough to understand.

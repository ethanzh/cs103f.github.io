    <p>When discussing Youtube's responsibilities from the perspective of advertisers, they can choose the audiences
        who they want to see their ads, but ultimately, Youtube is responsible for making sure that these ads are
        displayed in acceptable videos. From the perspective of users, it is Youtube's responsibility to make sure that
        the platform's videos do not promote misinformation or any sort of harmful content. Youtube lost many advertisers
        whose ads were displayed in videos shared by pedophiles, and this posed a great danger for the minors involved
        as well (Brodkin 2019). In addition, many false conspiracy theories and claims have also spread across Youtube
        like falsely accusing a student who spoke to the media following the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting of
        being a "crisis actor” (Lunden 2018). Thus, it is Youtube's responsibility to prevent such misleading or harmful
        content from appearing on its platform. </p>

    <p>YouTube has a content moderation team, as well as algorithms that aid with the detection of what should and
        should not be allowed on the platform. The conversation about what is allowed on YouTube is primarily from
        the media itself, as critics either agree or disagree with certain decisions the company makes. One could frame
        the situation as an extension of the first amendment, people should be able to say whatever they want.
        However, the situation can also be framed through the lens of exercising "reasonable judgement” on what should
        and shouldn't be allowed. This of course could potentially be a slippery slope as the YouTube has the final
        say in what is on the platform.</p>

    <p>Assuming a fair share of profits, Youtube's business model is ethical in theory. There's nothing wrong
        with monetizing a user's channel and allowing them to benefit from said monetization. However, I think
        very little would agree that it is ethical to profit off of videos that cause direct harm in the form of
        "fake news” and conspiracy theories that have even been known to have the consequence of leading to the
        harassment of minors. I would argue that due to the extreme nature of the harm caused, Youtube not only has
        the responsibility of demonetizing this content, but also removing it from the platform as well. However,
        this places an extra responsibility on the general public to make sure that these same standards are not
        applied by Youtube and other platforms to just remove any anti-establishment content they don't want to be seen. </p>

    <p>Technology is also to blame in the case of how YouTube handles its advertising. Youtube's current algorithm
        allows users to enter a "wormhole into soft-core pedophilia” (Brodkin 2019). What may start out as an innocent
        YouTube search can turn into a very graphic viewing. Therefore, it is reasonable to understand why advertisers
        are very to market their products in the platform when their ads could potential be played along disagreeable
        content.</p>
